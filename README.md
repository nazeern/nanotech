# Functional Mixture Modeling (FMM)
A robust, novel ML algorithm that enables high-accuracy regression on an input data curve.

This algorithm will be helpful if:
* You have multiple data curves each associated with some value and
* You want to predict the value associated with a new input curve

For a practical example, see the graph below. This algorithm can predict the value of the dotted black line with high accuracy:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed the latest versions of `jupyter notebook`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`
* You have viewed the [research presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rwh6_adjJUo_Exlv7RHaZNYgRLOLf3WRMXClNw4T8TA/edit#slide=id.g229f4b2fec3_0_77).
Make sure that this algorithm fits your use case!
